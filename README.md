**Engineering leader**, entrepreneur, and open-source advocate. Passionate about driving innovation, and sharing knowledge through code, documentation, and mentorship.

I help organizations deliver value across the board - from customers to engineers, executives, and all stakeholders - by fostering engineering excellence, aligning technology with business goals, and scaling teams to build high-quality software.

I occasionally engage in public speaking and have delivered more than [15 presentations](PUBLIC_SPEAKING.md) on topics predominantly related to software development, security and management.
