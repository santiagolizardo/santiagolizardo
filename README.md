**Software engineering leader**, entrepreneur and open source enthusiast. Contributor to PHP language extensions, Blender translations and dozens of other projects of my own. My areas of interest are primarerly security, graphics and game programming and, more recently, data science.

At work I help organisations create high performing engineering teams where value is delivered to the customer in short iterations and with high-quality, and where engineers and stakeholders operate as one team and enjoy the journey.
